### The meaning of African psychology

This section explores four definitions of African psychology in search of a precise meaning of the concept. **The four definitions are as follows**:

1. African psychology is a unified understanding of the multicultural realities of African people, their being and identity, as well as their unique traditions and cultures, which constitute their experience of everyday realities. This is a type of psychology that views a way of life through an African lens and recognizes indigenous knowledge to be valuable in understanding African people, their well-being and their problem- solving strategies. African psychology is “preoccupied with creating psychological knowledge that is situated in culture, history and material concerns of contemporary ways of living in Africa” (Oppong, 2022, p. 3).

Understanding this definition entails highlighting certain key ideas, such as viewing African psychology as a movement for preventing and solving problems of the African diaspora and as a social construct resulting from an analysis of the historical conditions of African people and the acquisition of rudimentary skills in African problem-solving by Africans. Moreover, the definition is important because of the recognition that the African diaspora sought to connect with their roots and unique ways of nurturing human cognitive, affective and behavior at all levels to prevent or deal with problems.

2. African psychology, according to Obasi and Smith (2009, pp. 47–48), is a dynamic manifestation of unifying African principles, values and traditions; it is the self- conscious centering of psychological analyses and applications in African reality, culture and epistemology. Obasi and Smith (2009, p. 48) explain that African psychology has a social mission and “rejects the Western doctrine of materialism and embraces the possibilities associated with a spirit-based ontological system”.

This definition implies that African psychology is derived from an African way of life, including African principles of knowledge production and application. The basic information guiding the components of African psychology was formed from knowledge produced through research on African realities and experiences. The key element of this definition is that African psychology entails the dissemination of indigenous knowledge, with a key focus on spiritual values, and that significant consideration should be given to the African context, which is characterized by principles such as caring for and supporting one another.

3. African psychology is a field of study interested in investigating and understanding the key psychological costs of being African and black in America (Jamison, 2008, p. 96).

What we can infer from this definition is that African psychology is regarded as the study of Africans and blacks in America. This definition focuses on the experience of African Americans and does not have the explanatory power to account for the continental experiences of African people (Maynard, 2013). Viewing African psychology from this perspective is somewhat limited because African psychology is a way of life; it is a means of nurturing and protecting the existence of humans, nature and animals. African psychology is more than just studying or understanding blacks in America – it cuts across all Africans because an understanding of the psychology of Africans in Africa and the African diaspora will provide more knowledge in the pursuit of understanding and reshaping the definition of African psychology.

4. African psychology “consists of the past and present people and cultures and experiences of life in Africa, with priority given to their individual and collective experiences; joys and losses; hopes and impediments; frustrations and challenges; needs and preferences; and attitudes to place, life, and land, death and the after-life, marriage and family, war and peace, spirituality and the supernatural order, morality and ethics, and African cultural institutions and practices” (Nwoye, 2015, p. 108).

This definition incorporates the ordinary and everyday experiences of African people. These experiences are informed by life before and after colonization. In addition, the definition captures people’s resilience in making life meaningful beyond the struggles of the past, finding healing and well-being through interdependence, defining a future and finding meaning through ancient African traditions and customs, which include spirituality, the supernatural and the other gods of African people.

### Indigenous African psychology

Indigenous African psychology is viewed in this section as a field of study that is concerned with bringing liberty and fairness to ancestral knowledge and practices that ensure African people’s cognitive, affective and behavioral well-being, thereby advancing clans towards sustainable survival and progress.

Higgs (2006) maintains that the importance of indigenous knowledge is that it denotes all aspects of locally produced and applied knowledge.

#### What is indigenous knowledge?

**Defined as**: The understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural surroundings. ... This knowledge is integral to a cultural complex that also encompasses language, systems of classification, resource use practices, social interactions, ritual and spirituality.

Indigenous knowledge is constructed through consideration of local contexts, concepts and methodologies.&#x20;

To get a better understanding of this definition of indigenous knowledge, we can **ask the following questions**:

* What “understandings”? Clans’ cognition, as well as their affects (emotions) and behaviors, are taken into account.
* What “skills”? Indigenous people’s skills to connect, communicate and interact with others in their contexts are taken into account
* What “philosophies”? The guiding philosophies of African culture, such as ubuntu and humane living, are taken into account
* What “cultural life systems”? Indigenous people’s cultural practices are not separated from their identity and selfhood

**Some of the components of indigenous communities are as follows**:

* A clan is a group of people bounded by relatedness such as kinship. In indigenous communities, a clan is comprised of people, nature, the environment and animals. This is because indigenous communities believe that reciprocal interaction and the patterns of such interaction ensure the survival of the planet and people. The sustainable development of a clan is rooted in learning the emotions and the behaviors that are acceptable within the clan. Also, knowledge of what is acceptable within a clan is taught with passion. Knowledge of how to practice what is taught is assessed in rituals that mark clan members’ transition to adulthood.
* Cognitive development is guided by ways of reasoning and ways of connecting to people, nature and animals to prevent problems and to advance sustainable development. Cognitive learning focuses on the development and improvement of reasoning, often referred to as common sense or native intelligence, to ensure that clan members connect, communicate and interact effectively.
* Affective development is guided by ways of displaying emotions and empathy for humans, nature and the environment. Affective learning focuses on developing ways of emotional display and control in private and public spaces and learning about strategies for showing empathy towards people, nature and animals.
* A clan's behavior is guided by a specific way of thinking, speaking and conduct towards humans, nature and animals. The behavior focuses on developing thoughts, words and actions to ensure respect in the patterns of connection, communication and interaction with people, nature and animals.
* Psychological learning in a clan includes teachings on the importance of nature, the environment and animals. Psychological learning focuses on skills such as how to protect and preserve the clan, that is, people, nature, the environment and animals. These skills include understanding the behavior of people and the natural environment, and emotions. For example, when music is playing, what message is the rhythm and the drumming conveying to people? When the seasons change, what type of vegetation can people plant? These skills can be updated to ensure clan members’ confidence to connect with people and nature.

Four definitions of indigenous psychology are as follows:

1. According to Sinha (1997), indigenous psychology refers to the process of making psychology reflect the knowledge, philosophies and culture of people based on their region and roots. The “proponents of indigenous psychology underscore the centrality of culture in understanding and defining human functioning” (Matoane, 2012, p. 107). This means that indigenous psychology is shaped by the culture from which it is derived.
2. Indigenous psychology also refers to any values, attitudes and beliefs of native people that have the capacity to influence human behavior (Kim & Berry, 1993; Kim et al., 2006)
3. Adair (1999, p. 405) describes indigenous psychology as “a growing acknowledgement of the limitations of Western models, an increasing acceptance of calls for problem-oriented research on national concerns, and a deepening sensitivity to the rich potential that exists in local customs and behaviors peculiarly driven by indigenous traditions”.
4. Allwood (2018, p. 1) regards indigenous psychology as “an approach to research in psychology which stresses the importance of research being grounded in the conditions of the researcher’s own society and culture”.

The understandings deduced from the above definitions of **indigenous psychology can be summarized as follows**:

* Indigenous psychology is guided by local philosophies and cultural practices.
* Indigenous psychology is conscious of people’s realities and their functioning in specific contexts.
* Indigenous psychology is developed from research on concepts and models obtained by exploring people’s lived experiences
* Indigenous psychology is responsive and context-relevant psychology.
* Indigenous psychology relies on cultural concepts and theories to understand human behavior.

#### Understanding indigenous African psychology

Indigenous African psychology is a culturally driven approach to promoting well-being and solving social issues, which differs from Western psychology. It acknowledges the importance of understanding human behavior in context and has been practiced in Africa for centuries, often being passed down through generations. This psychology is reflected in various cultural practices, such as folktales, and is acquired throughout different life stages. Elders play an important role in imparting this knowledge to younger generations for the continuity and survival of the community.

This approach to psychology remains relevant in modern African realities and can be applied to various aspects of daily life, including health, spirituality, work, and more. It predates scientific psychology as understood in the Western context and aims to produce honest, respectful, skilled, and cooperative individuals who conform to the social order.

Central to this psychology is the concept of ubuntu, a fundamental psychological method promoting health, human care, support, companionship, help, and healing. It suggests that African knowledge systems should be utilized to guide the profession when working with African communities. This knowledge can be adapted by psychology professionals in Africa to define psychology in relation to the African continent.

#### The scope of indigenous African psychology

* Health. Health psychology focuses on preventive and curative learning to promote healthy living and a positive ageing process. Herbs were tested and affirmed before usage. Motherhood, antenatal care and birth, as well as childcare, were managed by traditional birth attendants who educated new mothers on caring for themselves and their babies. Today, traditional herbs are still used by African people to treat psychological and physical illnesses. In South Africa, some tribes still use traditional herbs. Makgahlela and Sodi (2017) point out that, in some cultures, herbs are used to ease the psychological pain of grief and to help individuals forget painful memories associated with the deceased.
* Spirituality. Secret cults taught African philosophy, religion, science and secrets about their powers. Religious leaders imparted wisdom through parables, riddles, oral narratives, folklore, songs and dances. Some of these practices continue to be important in defining the modern-day spiritual practices of many African communities.
* Adulthood. Clan members were psychologically prepared for the transition into manhood and womanhood through the use of ritual rites and the teaching of adult duties and responsibilities. The older generation was tasked with preparing the younger generation for a life of service to the clan. Honesty in the performance of duties, both in clan and family life, respect for people, nature and animals, moderation in eating and drinking, chastity, commitment, self-confidence, self-sacrifice and humility were all greatly emphasized.
* Occupation/job orientation. Idleness was a great enemy to the clan, so functionalism (not a school of thought) was endorsed, making unemployment insignificant (Osokoya 1989). Psychological preparation for employment encouraged clan responsibilities, such as participation in the protection of the clan’s economic and political activities, and spiritual and moral values. Plants and trees required for carving, cooking, knitting, pottery, tying and dyeing (for example, dyeing of trees and roots with natural dye), and weaving and fishing were part of practical occupational psychological learning.
* Agriculture. Psychological teaching and learning regarding practical farming focused on understanding the weather and the soil and assessing seeds to ensure preservation for the next farm seasoning. Farm management was also taught to clan members from a very young age. Older adults taught the younger ones when to take the livestock (cows, sheep and goats) out for feeding and when to bring them back to avoid adversities of harsh weather. Psychological learning was important to the clan and the family because it was the mainstay of the economy.
* Recreational activities. Psychological learning promoted dancing, drumming, wrestling and racing. These activities had a psychological value because they brought clans together and increased socialization among individuals.
* Cognition. Cognitive (thinking), communication (spoken words) and behavioral (action) psychology was developed through the study of indigenous history, geography, nature, legends, poetry, reasoning, riddles, proverbs and storytelling. Clans’ ways of thinking, speaking and acting were guided by cultural rituals, practices and philosophies. These rituals, practices and philosophies were passed on from generation to generation through oral history. Cultural remains, relics and documents were used to guide cognitive, affective and behavioral activities. In the family and the clan, communication, interaction and relationship patterns were taught. Children were taught the value and the consequences of thoughts, words and actions by the older members of the family. Cognitive processes (i.e., thoughts and spoken words) were encouraged through teachings in critical thinking, the analysis of thoughts and the consequences of words before speaking. The cognition of children and young adults was developed, strengthened and improved through storytelling. Storytelling psychology is an attempt to use stories to shape the thoughts, words and actions of children and young adults in both private and public life. The storytelling psychology curriculum was developed based on first- hand knowledge of clan legends, animals and the natural environment. The power of reasoning was instilled in children and young adults by narrating stories of pleasant and unpleasant circumstances, ensuring that they were intellectually mature, emotionally strong and behaviorally sound. Psychological learning was practical and rooted in self-respect and respect for others. To ensure anger management, self-control and respect for oneself and others, children and young adults were taught to speak only when spoken to and to respond only when they were allowed to. As a result, the concept of “do not speak until you are spoken to” was developed, and greatly misused and misunderstood in modern African society where it is interpreted as oppression and denial of freedom of speech. However, in indigenous communities controlled by older people (who are the custodians of cultural values and norms), the concept is regarded as a psychological process of teaching children and young adults the art of active listening and reasoning in order to defend oneself and to gain self-respect while respecting others. Another point of view was that this concept was part of a process of making children and young adults aware of their surroundings and teaching them to think critically, analytically and objectively before speaking to bring forth wisdom.
* Affective learning. Clan members and families were taught how to prioritize people through the provision of social work services for orphans and widows. The clan- centered system taught people that the clan and the family came before the individual, meaning that destitution was insignificant in indigenous communities. Again, music was used to guide emotional learning; the sound and the volume of musical instruments were intended to incite or calm emotional behavior. Emotions were described, explained and depicted using crafts and arts.
