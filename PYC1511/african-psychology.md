### The meaning of African psychology

This section explores four definitions of African psychology in search of a precise meaning of the concept. **The four definitions are as follows**:

1. African psychology is a unified understanding of the multicultural realities of African people, their being and identity, as well as their unique traditions and cultures, which constitute their experience of everyday realities. This is a type of psychology that views a way of life through an African lens and recognizes indigenous knowledge to be valuable in understanding African people, their well-being and their problem- solving strategies. African psychology is “preoccupied with creating psychological knowledge that is situated in culture, history and material concerns of contemporary ways of living in Africa” (Oppong, 2022, p. 3).

Understanding this definition entails highlighting certain key ideas, such as viewing African psychology as a movement for preventing and solving problems of the African diaspora and as a social construct resulting from an analysis of the historical conditions of African people and the acquisition of rudimentary skills in African problem-solving by Africans. Moreover, the definition is important because of the recognition that the African diaspora sought to connect with their roots and unique ways of nurturing human cognitive, affective and behavior at all levels to prevent or deal with problems.

2. African psychology, according to Obasi and Smith (2009, pp. 47–48), is a dynamic manifestation of unifying African principles, values and traditions; it is the self- conscious centering of psychological analyses and applications in African reality, culture and epistemology. Obasi and Smith (2009, p. 48) explain that African psychology has a social mission and “rejects the Western doctrine of materialism and embraces the possibilities associated with a spirit-based ontological system”.

This definition implies that African psychology is derived from an African way of life, including African principles of knowledge production and application. The basic information guiding the components of African psychology was formed from knowledge produced through research on African realities and experiences. The key element of this definition is that African psychology entails the dissemination of indigenous knowledge, with a key focus on spiritual values, and that significant consideration should be given to the African context, which is characterized by principles such as caring for and supporting one another.

3. African psychology is a field of study interested in investigating and understanding the key psychological costs of being African and black in America (Jamison, 2008, p. 96).

What we can infer from this definition is that African psychology is regarded as the study of Africans and blacks in America. This definition focuses on the experience of African Americans and does not have the explanatory power to account for the continental experiences of African people (Maynard, 2013). Viewing African psychology from this perspective is somewhat limited because African psychology is a way of life; it is a means of nurturing and protecting the existence of humans, nature and animals. African psychology is more than just studying or understanding blacks in America – it cuts across all Africans because an understanding of the psychology of Africans in Africa and the African diaspora will provide more knowledge in the pursuit of understanding and reshaping the definition of African psychology.

4. African psychology “consists of the past and present people and cultures and experiences of life in Africa, with priority given to their individual and collective experiences; joys and losses; hopes and impediments; frustrations and challenges; needs and preferences; and attitudes to place, life, and land, death and the after-life, marriage and family, war and peace, spirituality and the supernatural order, morality and ethics, and African cultural institutions and practices” (Nwoye, 2015, p. 108).

This definition incorporates the ordinary and everyday experiences of African people. These experiences are informed by life before and after colonization. In addition, the definition captures people’s resilience in making life meaningful beyond the struggles of the past, finding healing and well-being through interdependence, defining a future and finding meaning through ancient African traditions and customs, which include spirituality, the supernatural and the other gods of African people.
