**Purpose:** The purpose of the module is to equip students with skills, knowledge, competencies, values and attitudes to the study of Psychology from an African perspective. The module serves as a theoretical basic foundation for further studies in psychology with an emphasis on understanding the broad fields of psychology as they emerge in Africa. The module will equip the learner with a holistic understanding of psychology and its past. The learner will have an introductory knowledge on how psychology has contributed to the power structures that legitimized inequalities in societies, particularly in Africa. The aim is also to enable the learner to understand, and embrace the African ways of knowing the human functioning. The module also enables the learner to distinguish between the African and the Western ways of thinking in terms of the philosophies that inform how people view the world.

**This unit deals** with psychology as the study of human behavior and how, owing to the geographic location of its origins, the knowledge created from its conceptualization continues to have consequences for African people.

#### The origin of psychology in Africa

According to **Nsamenang** (2007), Euro-American psychology was introduced to Africa during the colonial period partly through Christian missionaries, visiting Western psychologists and Africans who were returning from universities abroad after being trained in conventional Western psychology.

From this world view, **psychology is defined as** the study of thought, emotions and observed behavior _(APA, 2015)_, emphasizing the “scientific” aspect of psychology.

**Nwoye** _(2015a, p. 104)_ defines psychology as the “_systematic and informed study of the complexities of human mental life, culture and experience in the pre- and post-colonial African world_”

<summary>Universities being established all over Africa</summary>

Universities in Africa were established following Africa’s colonial contact with Europe. Most of them started in the 1960s and 1970s after colonized countries gained political independence from their former colonizers, such as Britain, France, Belgium, Germany and Portugal. Some of the universities, like the University of Ibadan (Nigeria), the University of Ghana (Ghana), the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Makerere University (Uganda) and the University of Nairobi (Kenya), started as offshore colleges of the University of London, initially flying the flag of their “mother university” and offering various courses (including psychology) that were developed abroad and imported to Africa.

#### Psychology and location

<mark style="color:red;">The word “</mark><mark style="color:red;">**psychology**</mark><mark style="color:red;">” is</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**derived from Greek**</mark><mark style="color:red;">. The first part of the word comes from the Greek psychē, which refers to the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**soul**</mark><mark style="color:red;">; the second part comes from the Greek logos, which refers to</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**studying a particular subject**</mark><mark style="color:red;">.</mark>

It could be concluded that psychology is **the study of the soul**.

Given that some people are in Africa, and Greece is in Europe, a few critical points need to be raised:

1. The first critical issue is that people’s location often determines their world view.

**A world view** can be defined as a set of **presumptions that particular people have about the world**. Their ideas can be about the world, God, life, death, love, how to heal sickness, their relationship with nature, and so on.

This concept is referred to as <mark style="color:red;">**epistemic location**</mark>. In terms of this concept, people generate their world views from a particular geopolitical context and qualify truths based on their positioning \
_(Mignolo, 2002)_.

<summary>Grosfoguel questions western psychology</summary>

Consequently, psychology is not value free but is informed by a cultural reference. In the same breath, _Grosfoguel_ (2013) questions why disciplines such as psychology are based on ideas and theories only from Western nations, thus questioning the contextual relevance and applicability of such theories in non-Western contexts.

</details>

2. The second critical point to examine is the idea of science informing the study of psychology.

**Science in psychology** implies a couple of things about the human psyche. It implies, for instance, that human behavior, emotions and thought can be studied objectively.

This can lead people to think about human beings in a mechanical way as though no other factors contribute to human behavior and may not reflect the complexities of society in informing human behavior.

3. Who decides what human processes are within the scope of psychology to study?

Why do they get to make this determination? \
On whose behalf do they make decisions? \
What are the consequences of developing a limited scope of studying psychology?

#### Psychology in Egypt

Three significant events occurred in the 19th century that influenced the rise of psychology in Egypt (Ahmed, 1992)

1. The Al-Abssia Mental Health Hospital, the first mental hospital for Africa and the Arab world, was opened in Cairo in <mark style="color:green;">1880</mark>.
2. The newspapers and magazines distributed to the public paved the way for psychology in Egypt. These newspapers and magazines were established in Cairo and Alexandria, primarily by a group of immigrant Lebanese and Syrian journalists _(Ahmed, 2005)_.
3. Egypt started to expand its schooling system by establishing schools all over the country, including teachers’ schools, whose curriculum included some basic psychology training.

#### Psychology in South Africa

In South Africa, it became perverted to fulfill a political purpose. As Marx (2013) notes, it was believed that the Bantu were not simply less developed than Europeans; rather, the belief was that their culture differed fundamentally from European culture and was incompatible with it.

<summary>University of Cape Town is established</summary>

Higher education in South Africa can be traced back to <mark style="color:green;">1829</mark>, when the South African College (later the University of Cape Town) was established in Cape Town (Cooper & Nicholas, 2012). This college prepared students for matriculation and examinations at the University of London.

<summary>University of Good Hope</summary>

In <mark style="color:green;">1873</mark>, the University of Good Hope was established as an examining body for degrees conferred in South Africa

<summary>University Act of South Africa</summary>

In 1916, the University Act of South Africa launched the University of South Africa, the University of Stellenbosch and the South African Native College (later the University Fort Hare).

Psychology was taught in philosophy departments until <mark style="color:green;">1917</mark>

RW Wilcocks (1892– 1967) was appointed as Professor of Logic and Psychology at the University of Stellenbosch after he had received his doctorate in the analysis of productive thought at the University of Berlin in <mark style="color:green;">1917</mark>

He established the first experimental psychology laboratory modeled on Wundt’s laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch (Louw & Foster, 1991).

<summary>First black ...</summary>

Chabani N Manganyi became the first black psychologist in <mark style="color:green;">1965</mark> and established the Department of Psychology at the University of Transkei in <mark style="color:green;">1976</mark> (now Walter Sisulu University).&#x20;

Josephine Naidoo was the first black person to apply for South African Psychological Association membership.&#x20;

Sathasivan Cooper, who frequently met with political activists, such as Steve Biko, Harry Nengwekhulu and Strini Moodley, helped to establish the Black Consciousness philosophy and was instrumental in the formation of the student’s representative council (SRC) at the University College. His political ideologies later led to his suspension from university in <mark style="color:green;">1969</mark>. He steered the merger with the University of Natal to form what is now known as the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

#### Psychology in Zambia

In a study of reasoning in specific non- language-based school examination tasks, it was discovered that poor performance in the tasks was related to socioeconomic background and thus to familiarity with and acquired skills in dealing with the information presented as pictures (Okonji, 1971). This meant that psychology and its methodological applications had to be redefined to fit the context.

From this section, one gathers that the “how” and the “where” that inform the definition of psychology are crucial to how the study of psychology becomes an extension of oppressive political systems like colonization, apartheid and imperialism.
