**Purpose:** The purpose of the module is to equip students with skills, knowledge, competencies, values and attitudes to the study of Psychology from an African perspective. The module serves as a theoretical basic foundation for further studies in psychology with an emphasis on understanding the broad fields of psychology as they emerge in Africa. The module will equip the learner with a holistic understanding of psychology and its past. The learner will have an introductory knowledge on how psychology has contributed to the power structures that legitimized inequalities in societies, particularly in Africa. The aim is also to enable the learner to understand, and embrace the African ways of knowing the human functioning. The module also enables the learner to distinguish between the African and the Western ways of thinking in terms of the philosophies that inform how people view the world.
